# Transcript


So basically a Student creates an account -> Course has modules ->  Modules has content, E.g. exam and coursework 

I believe for all the unknow values, 
The bare minimum for all the unknown values in order to get a first/second will be ideal 
It alters as more grades are acquired for each content 

The Front End Interacts with the Student 
The backend stores the user details 

Vik and Lincoln work.
